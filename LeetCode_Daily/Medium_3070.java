3070. Count Submatrices with Top-Left Element and Sum Less Than k

You are given a 0-indexed integer matrix grid and an integer k.

Return the number of submatrices that contain the top-left element of the grid, and have a sum less than or equal to k.

 

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[7,6,3],[6,6,1]], k = 18
Output: 4
Explanation: There are only 4 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 18.
Example 2:


Input: grid = [[7,2,9],[1,5,0],[2,6,6]], k = 20
Output: 6
Explanation: There are only 6 submatrices, shown in the image above, that contain the top-left element of grid, and have a sum less than or equal to 20.
 

Constraints:

m == grid.length 
n == grid[i].length
1 <= n, m <= 1000 
0 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000
1 <= k <= 109

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                px[i+1][j+1] = grid[i][j] + px[i][j+1] + px[i+1][j] - px[i][j];
                if (px[i+1][j+1] <= k) ans++;
            }
        }
        return ans;
