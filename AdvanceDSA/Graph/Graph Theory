Graph Data Structure is a collection of nodes connected by edges. It's used to represent relationships between different entities.

Basics:

A graph is a non-linear data structure made up of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections) that represent relationships between objects.

Components:

1. Vertices: Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph. Sometimes, vertices are also known as vertex or nodes.
    Every node/vertex can be labeled or unlabelled.
2. Edges: Edges are drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph. It can be ordered pair of nodes in a directed graph.
    Edges can connect any two nodes in any possible way. There are no rules. Sometimes, edges are also known as arcs. Every edge can be labelled/unlabelled.
